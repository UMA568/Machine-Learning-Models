# Machine Learning Models

I have implemented multiple Machine Learning algorithms using two different approaches:
âœ… From Scratch (Fit Model approach) â€“ To understand the core logic behind ML models using custom Python code.
âœ… Using Scikit-Learn â€“ To compare performance with optimized library implementations.
